# Asteroids Game Made with Pygame

A work in progress asteroids game made in Python using Pygame.

Able to move and shoot. Larger asteroids 'explode' into smaller asteroids. Score keeping.

Currently no ship collision detection and therefore no way to lose.


## Installation

Clone repository. Install Python modules from requirements.txt.


## Other

I created this to become familiar with Pygame and Python classes. This by no means uses best practices and development will be slow.
